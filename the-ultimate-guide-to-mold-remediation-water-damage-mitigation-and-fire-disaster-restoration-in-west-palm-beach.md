### **Understanding the Scope of Disaster Restoration in South Florida**

#### **Why Is Restoration Critical in Florida?**

Florida's humid subtropical climate makes it particularly prone to moisture-
related issues like mold growth and water damage, especially during hurricane
season. The region’s vulnerability to fire hazards also necessitates a
comprehensive emergency response plan. Recognizing these risks is the first
step toward effective mitigation.
