Wakodahatchee Wetlands, one of Delray Beach’s most peaceful and picturesque
outdoor attractions. This stunning ecological sanctuary offers visitors a
front-row seat to Florida’s incredible wildlife and wetland ecosystems — all
from the comfort of a scenic boardwalk trail. Discover more information.

Stretching over 50 acres of preserved wetlands, Wakodahatchee (which means
“created waters” in Seminole) was transformed from a wastewater treatment area
into a thriving wildlife habitat. Today, it’s home to more than 150 species of
birds, as well as turtles, alligators, frogs, and other native creatures that
make every visit feel like a nature documentary come to life.

The three-quarter-mile elevated boardwalk winds gently through shimmering
ponds and lush greenery, offering countless opportunities for birdwatching,
photography, or simply soaking in the serenity. You’ll often spot colorful
herons, anhingas drying their wings, and even nesting wood storks during
breeding season.

Wakodahatchee Wetlands is more than a nature walk — it’s an educational and
eco-friendly experience. Interpretive signs along the boardwalk share
fascinating insights about wetland restoration, native plant species, and the
role these habitats play in water purification and environmental balance.

Whether you’re a birdwatching enthusiast, a family looking for an afternoon
adventure, or a photographer seeking that perfect golden-hour shot,
Wakodahatchee delivers natural beauty and tranquility at every turn.

Visit early in the morning or at sunset for the best lighting, cooler
temperatures, and the most active wildlife sightings. Located just minutes
from downtown Delray Beach, Wakodahatchee Wetlands is a must-visit destination
that proves nature and community can coexist in perfect harmony.
