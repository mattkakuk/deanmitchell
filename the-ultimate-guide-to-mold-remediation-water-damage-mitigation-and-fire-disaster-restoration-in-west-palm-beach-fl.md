## **Understanding Mold Growth and Its Risks**

### **What Is Mold and Why Is It Dangerous?**

Mold is a type of fungus that thrives in damp, humid environments—like your
basement, attic, or bathroom. It reproduces quickly and can cause health
issues, particularly for allergy sufferers or those with respiratory
conditions.

### **Common Places for Mold to Develop in West Palm Beach Homes**

In our subtropical climate, mold growth is especially prevalent. Think behind
walls, under sinks, or in HVAC systems—places where moisture is likely to
accumulate in Palm Beach County.

### **Signs You Need Mold Remediation**

  * Visible black or green patches
  * Unpleasant musty odors
  * Persistent allergies or respiratory issues
  * Water leaks or water damage signs

## **Mold Remediation Process—Restoring a Healthy Environment**

### **Step 1: Inspection and Assessment**

A thorough inspection identifies mold presence and moisture sources. At Dean
Mitchell Restoration, we utilize advanced tools for accurate detection.

### **Step 2: Containment and Air Filtration**

To prevent mold spores from spreading, we isolate affected areas and deploy
HEPA filters.

### **Step 3: Removal and Cleaning**

We remove contaminated materials and clean surfaces with professional-grade
solutions to eliminate mold spores.

### **Step 4: Moisture Control and Prevention**

Dehumidification and addressing leaks stop mold regrowth. For the best
results, proactive moisture control is essential.
