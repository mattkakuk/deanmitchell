## Understanding the Importance of Professional Restoration Services

### Why Skip DIY When Handling Severe Damage?

Handling restoration independently may seem tempting, but without the
necessary expertise, you risk further damage or health hazards. Professionals
ensure thorough cleanup, safety, and adherence to legal standards, especially
when mold or hazardous debris is involved.

### The Role of Certified Experts in Restoration

Company accreditation and certifications, such as IICRC (Institute of
Inspection, Cleaning, and Restoration Certification), set reputable
restoration services apart. Restoring your property correctly requires both
skill and experience—something we take seriously at Dean Mitchell Restoration.
